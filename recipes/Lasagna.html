        <h1>Lasagna</h1>

        <p><h4>Description</h4></p>
        <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck.</p>
        <p>It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
        <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been</p> 
        <p>cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small</p>
        <p>army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
